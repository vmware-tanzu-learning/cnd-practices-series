This is a series of lectures and workshops for developers and
application operators new to cloud native concepts who wish to learn the
basics of:

- Leveraging modern platform features to move fast, but safely
- Leveraging modern practices to move fast, but safely

The series roadmap of workshops and/or associated tracks are as follows
(items with * are available or confirmed):

Fundamentals introduction series (100 level)

-   Cloud Native introduction*
-   Personas and Roles*
-   Practices and Guidelines*
-   Modern Platform Concepts*

Fundamentals - Making a single application deployment cloud native (100 level)

-   Containerization and deployment of a web application*
-   Handling environmental configuration*
-   Application and deployment lifecycle management*
-   Zero downtime upgrades*
-   Scaling an application*
-   Monitoring an application
-   Introduction to fault tolerance, resilience, chaos engineering (fail fast, socket timeout, retry/backoff)
-   Automation, Continuous Integration and Delivery Pipelines
-   REST applications
-   Database migrations and versioning
-   Backing Services

Fundamentals - Evolving to microservices (100 level)

-   Evolving a codebase -> monolith to microservices (App Continuum)
-   Introduction to distributed applications (Microservices)
-   Classifying the problems encountered when introducing Microservices
-   API Versioning
-   Specialized concepts for microservices solution patterns:
    - Service Discovery
    - Client Load Balancing
    - Distributed Trace
    - API gateways
    - Advanced fault tolerance, resilience and antifragility (fallback, circuit break, bulkhead, walk-away timeout)
-   Architecture Styles (when blocking web application style is not enough):
    -   Event-based architectures
        - Serverless
        - Webhooks
        - Event sourcing
        - CQRS
    -   Reactive (non-blocking)
    -   Streams
    -   Batch (in a Cloud Native friendly way)

Putting things together (200 series) - Evolve a codebase from greenfield to post day 2 ops

- See [PAL Tracker Evolution](https://github.com/platform-acceleration-lab/pal-tracker-evolution#readme), each release is a workshop to apply fundamentals principles.

The series provides foundational background to best leverage Tanzu
Developer Center Spring, Spring Boot or Kubernetes content, as well as
Tanzu products
